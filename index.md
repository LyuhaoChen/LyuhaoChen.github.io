## About Me

I am a Master’s student at Carnegie Mellon University studying Computer Engineering, with a strong focus on natural language processing and large language models. My research interests lie in **LLMs for reasoning, structured data understanding, and long-context summarization**, with an emphasis on evaluation and training methods.

Before CMU, I received my Bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University, College of Computer Science and Technology, where I developed a solid foundation in machine learning, systems, and data-driven modeling.

## Research Interests

- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** reasoning, instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, long-context modeling  
- **Natural Language Processing:** summarization, table reasoning, document-level QA, evaluation benchmarks  
- **Agent Systems:** multi-agent interaction, memory and emotion modeling, social simulation  
- **Machine Learning:** representation learning, generalization, data-efficient learning  

## News

- **[Apr. 2025]** Working on emotion-aware multi-agent systems and social interaction simulation.
- **[Mar. 2025]** Research on table reasoning with LLMs using supervised fine-tuning and RL (GRPO).
- **[2024]** Conducted research on long-context reasoning and evaluation benchmarks for LLMs.
